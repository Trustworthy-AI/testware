TestWare
======
> **WARNING**: This repository is provided solely for simulation research purposes. It should not be used to drive cars. 

TestWare is a minimally invasive fork of the Autoware Architecture Proposal, a prototype system targeted at SAE Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities. 

### Utilities for CARLA
**Sensors:** We include utilities which read the sensor configuation and instantiate the specified sensors and transforms on the CARLA ego vehicle. See ``CarlaUtils.py`` for details. In addition we provide methods for converting the measurements of these sensors to ROS messages and publishing the serialized data to Autoware in a synchronous manner (along with a clock which accurately reflects the state of CARLA's physics engine). 

**Control:** 

### Resetting the environment


### Synchronous execution

### Other notes
Docker version, NVIDIA drivers, Carla versions, egg file, other maps

# Dependencies
We have tested the code on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, and 20.04 machines. Some features of the Autoware Architecture Proposal (and thus TestWare) require CUDA; therefore, we are skeptical that it will be possible to use OSX or Windows machines, even with Docker. We do not provide any support for non-Ubuntu operating systems.

## Python 3.7
Depending on your Linux distro this should already be preinstalled. This dependency is due to the requirements of CARLA 0.9.9 rather than any aspect of TestPilot.

## Docker
Install [Docker for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/). Make sure to `sudo usermod -aG docker your-user` and then you do not need to run below docker scripts as `sudo`

## Python Libraries
Dependencies are detailed in requirements.txt
* `colorama 0.4.3`
* `cython 0.29.21`
* `numba 0.51.2`
* `numpy 1.19.2`
* `opencv-python 4.4.0.42`
* `pygame 1.9.6`
* `pyzmq 19.0.2`

Newer versions of these libraries likely work but have not been tested.

## CARLA (to run the demo)
Get CARLA from https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases. We have validated TestWare with CARLA releases 0.9.10.1. Note that for 0.9.9.x and above, visuals and weather look best using Vulkan instead of OpenGL when running CARLA. 


# Setup
0. Run `./build_docker.sh`

# Running the demo
0. Start CARLA on port 2010.
	
	An example of this command would be `DISPLAY= ./CarlaUE4.sh -opengl -quality-level=Epic -carla-world-port=2010` from a directory that contains the binary `CarlaUE4.sh`
1. Run `./run_docker.sh`
2. Run `source /AutowareArchitectureProposal/devel/setup.bash` inside the docker
3. Run `python demo.py`
